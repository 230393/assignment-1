                        "As I said before, we must begin everything anew. The previous government destroyed everything. So, from that destruction we need to rise afresh. That’s why we are establishing commissions for all fields. We have made six commissions; more commissions will come soon. Of those, one commission is on the constitution. The whole country wants the constitution to be amended. However, the topic may be subject to debate. That’s why the commission will create guidelines for those debates. That will give the country an opportunity to debate on it so that the political parties can give their opinion and can decide whether they are going to amend right now or later, and what exactly they would do. The constitution that we have now will not be helpful. If the country runs according to the present constitution, the same situation will happen again."
